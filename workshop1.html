<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This workshop is the first of many created  to help you pick up the basics of cloud design and development, then progress through to more cloud infrastructure design and development. These workshops are designed to help you understand fundamental cloud concepts and as such it is vital you complete ALL of them. 
    Therefore please take the time to go through all of the workshops. 
    You can also continue working on the workshop tasks from home as the software requirements are basic (Internet browser). 
    You are expected to go beyond the material and tasks presented in the workshops by attempting more advanced tasks and materials, some homeworks will be provided as well.</p>
<p>The primary goal of this workshop is to ensure you have your&nbsp; <strong>Google Cloud hand-on labs and account</strong> setup, as well as familiarising yourself with the platform tools. 

<h2>Google Cloud Skills Boost Platform</h2>
<p>Cloud Skills Boost Platform (formerley known as Qwiklabs) is a learning platform that has deep integration with the Google Cloud Platform, essentially it provides a sandboxed environment for you to complete cloud labs through a browser. As a student on this module you have been given access to carry out many of the mandatory workshop tasks and tutorials as part of this module.
     Each lab exercise carries a 'credit' weighting, credits are required to do each lab task and these vary from lab to lab. 
     The module coordinator has been allocated enough credits for all students on the module to complete all labs that are presented in each workshop.
    </p>

     <p style="color:red"><strong>When you carry out ANY lab exercise, please always remember that you must use the temporary GCP login details that are listed to the left of each lab - DO NOT login to the Google platform using your own GCP/gmail account details.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Registering and Signing in to  Google Cloud Skills Boost Platform</h3>
<p>Firstly, if you havent already done so, you will need to create a Qwiklabs account <a href="https://www.qwiklabs.com/users/sign_up">here</a> by using your <strong>university email address </strong>- <u>do not</u> use the &quot;Signin with Google&quot;option! :</p>
<p><img src="images/boost1.PNG" width="486" height="574" alt=""/></p>
<p>With the account setup using your university email address, it will automatically be added to a group that will give all students access to free credits to run the weekly lab tasks. Please note you will see a credit value that may be in the 1000s, note this is a <strong>pool of credits</strong> for all students to use, so don't be alarmed if you notice this value going down more than the credits you have personally used.</p>

<h3>Lab 1b</h3>
<p>Before you begin this lab there is a part that students may find confusing. When the lab asks you to use a command to  "Identify your default region and zone", and you do not see the value, then just use the zone value of <strong>us-central1-a</strong> whenever the lab asks you to set the zone.</p>
<p>Please login to your account and complete the<strong> Getting Started with Cloud Shell &amp; gcloud</strong> lab <a href="https://qwiklabs.com/focuses/563?parent=catalog">here</a> &lt; PLEASE ENSURE YOU DO THIS LAB!</p>
